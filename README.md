***Explain how a grad (f)= nabla(f) function works to a young child***
```math
{grad}(f) = \nabla f
```

> Imagine you have a big, beautiful garden filled with all sorts of flowers, trees, and other plants. Each plant has its own unique shape and size, and they are all arranged in a specific way.
> 
> Now, imagine that you want to measure how quickly the garden is growing. You could do this by measuring the height of each plant, one by one. This would take a long time, and it would be difficult to keep track of all the measurements.
> 
> Instead, you can use a special tool called the gradient to measure the growth of the garden. The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the greatest change in a function. In this case, the function is the height of the plants in the garden.
> 
> To calculate the gradient, you would first need to choose a starting point in the garden. Then, you would measure the height of the plants at that point and at a nearby point. The difference between these two measurements would give you the change in height.
> 
> Next, you would need to find the direction of the greatest change. To do this, you would draw a line between the two points where you measured the height of the plants. The direction of this line would be the direction of the greatest change.
> 
> Finally, you would need to calculate the magnitude of the gradient. This is the length of the vector that points in the direction of the greatest change.
> 
> The gradient can be used to measure the growth of the garden in any direction. For example, you could use it to measure the growth in the north-south direction, the east-west direction, or the diagonal direction.
> 
> The gradient is a powerful tool for understanding and measuring change. It is used in many different areas of science and engineering, including:
> 
> * Physics
> * Engineering
> * Mathematics
> * Computer science
> 
> The gradient is a fundamental tool for understanding how the world around us works.
> 
> Here is a simple example of how the gradient can be used to find the direction of the greatest change in a function:
> 
> Imagine you have a function that represents the height of a hill. The gradient of this function at a given point would point in the direction of the steepest slope at that point. This information could be used to find the path of least resistance up the hill.
> 
> The gradient is also used in many different areas of computer science, including:

> * Machine learning
> * Computer graphics
> * Robotics

> The gradient is a fundamental tool for understanding and manipulating data. It is used in a wide variety of applications, from image processing to natural language processing to financial modeling.
